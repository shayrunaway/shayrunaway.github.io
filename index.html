            <h2>Howdy! I'm Shay Hart</h2>
            <p>
                I am a passionate student with interests in data and programming. I enjoy building projects that combine technical skills with creativity, and I'm always eager to learn new things.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started my journey with the internet and programming young. At age nine I developed a passion for endlessly editing garish Myspace layouts, eventually growing into a small teenage side business of creating <a href="https://homeiswheremyblogis.tumblr.com">Tumblr themes</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I find that most people view the world of information technology through a structured and clinical lens. However, I find it to be more intrinsically linked to the humanities than one might imagine on first impression. Code is language and art combined into one.
