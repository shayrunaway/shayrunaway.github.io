    <h1>Welcome to Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Shay Hart. I am 28 years old and pursuing an associate degree in computer science. I currently work full-time for American National Insurance. I have lived in Springfield, MO for ten years now. I moved here when I was seventeen from Detroit, MI after visiting on a field trip. I love this city, and it has given me everything I could ever ask for from life (except perhaps for a bigger concert venue).</p>

    <h2>Life</h2>
    <p>I spend most of my time reading creative nonfiction. I feel that it expands my knowledge base and worldview in a more enjoyable way than pure nonfiction. Otherwise, I stay fairly occupied with my partner of five years, Josh, and our three pets. We have two cats that are siblings, Peter Pan and Tinkerbell, as well as a dog named Lunchbox. My pets are very distracting while I am trying to do classwork, so I may need to start frequenting coffee shops.</p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>My eventual dream is to pursue a bachelor's degree in data science. I have been working with data and programming in my current and previous jobs for three years now. I hope to further my career through my degrees as I thoroughly enjoy anything creative and computer-related.</p>
