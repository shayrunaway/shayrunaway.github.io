            <li>Each puzzle consists of a 9x9 grid, divided into 3x3 subgrids (Or houses).</li>
            <li>Your objective is to fill every cell using the numbers 1-9.</li>
            <li>The trick is that each number (1-9) may be used only once per column, once per row, and once per house.</li>
            <li>This means that every column, row, and house will each have a value of 45 in the end, called the <a href="https://www.sudopedia.org/wiki/45_rule">45 rule</a>.</li>
            <li>Each puzzle begins with some cells filled in called givens. The more difficult the puzzle the less givens you will begin with.</li>
            <li>Every valid Sudoku puzzle has only one correct solution.</li>
            <li>There is no need for guessing! Every puzzle can be solved with logic and utilizing techniques developed to assist.</li>
            <li>Sudoku used to be an exclusively pen and paper pursuit, but with today's technology you can play anywhere you go!</li>
